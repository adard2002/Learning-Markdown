# What is Growth Mindset?

## Growth Mindset- 

* When you are in the process of learning something. It means to expand your mind and to not give up on something just because someone else is better at the subject than you are. They were once at that stage too. Everyone starts somewhere, baby steps are still steps. When someone criticizes you don't feel bad, instead take advantage of it and see where you made the mistake and take note of what to do next time.

## What are some ways you can help keep a good growth mindset?

- People don't just magically get good at something. Don't think poorly of yourself when comparing to someone who is better at a subject than you are. They were once at your level too. They put in effort to be what they are now. If you try hard enough to get to where you wanna be, you will make it.

- Don't think of critisizm as a negative thing. Instead, think of it as what you could do to be better the next time you try at something. Critisizm is all apart of learning something. 

- Don't give up on something just because your friend is better at something than you are. Instead of thinking "I can't do this" say "I can try a different strategy." go at it with a positive attitude.
